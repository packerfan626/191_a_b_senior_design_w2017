    	Federal law defines child pornography as any visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct involving a minor, and the United STates Department of Justice may prosecute offenses occurring across state of international borders and almost any offense involving the Internet.<br>

    	Though their laws were created to protect minors from explotation, states are prosecuting minors under child pornography statutes for sending nude or other lurid self-portraits, even when the minors sends the photos without coercion.
		It is important to distinguish child pornography from the conventional understanding of the term pornography. It is a form of child sexual exploitation, and each image graphically sexually memorializes the sexaul abuse of that child. Each child involved in the production of an image is a victim of sexual abuse.
