        It is important to distinguish child pornography from the conventional understanding of the term pornography. It is a form of child sexual exploitation, and each image graphically sexually memorializes the sexual abuse of that child. Each child involved in the production of an image is a victim of sexual abuse.

    	Though their laws were created to protect minors from explotation, states are prosecuting minors under child pornography statutes for sending nude or other lurid self-portraits, even when the minors sends the photos without coercion.

		The “Selfie” quickly became part of the mainstream lexicon in 2013. A “selfie” is a self-portrait photograph that’s often taken with a camera phone, webcam, or digital camera. The explosion of social media networks and the rise of the camera phone have created endless opportunities for anyone to share their self-portraits with the world. 
This emerging technology is a natural fit for most teens, and, generally, the worst offense they might commit is sharing too frequently.As asforementioned, minors themselves can be prosecuted under child pornography statutes when selfies involve underage nudity or sexual situations.
