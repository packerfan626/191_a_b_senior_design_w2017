                        As in the case with children, perpetrators of trafficking employ a
                        “grooming process” to draw their victims away from their homes or to gain the
                        trust and dependency of young victims who may have run away from home. The
                        following steps is an example of a common grooming process that occurs in adults.

                                        The first step is often the development of a relationship with
                                        an older man, who the victim comes to regard as her “boyfriend”.
                                        The perpetrator assesses the victim’s needs (vulnerabilities)
                                        and offers flattery, material items such as money, jewelry or
                                        clothes, and/or displays other “acts of love”. The adolescent
                                        female may be enticed to begin a sexual relationship with her
                                        “boyfriend”. The adolescent will be encouraged to stay away from
                                        home for increasingly longer periods of time, eventually leading
                                        to her not returning home at all.

                                        Within a short period of time, the victim is often encouraged to
                                        take a short trip with the “boyfriend” for what seems like a
                                        reasonable cause. It is often at this point that the perpetrator
                                        will try to convince the victim to prostitute herself. The
                                        “boyfriend” may start the process of exploitation by introducing
                                        the victim to other groups of men and asking the victim to provide
                                        sexual favors to the men because they are his “friends”. If the
                                        victim doesn’t agree to do so, she will then be subjected to
                                        violence, abuse, or other coercive measures, with the objective
                                        of giving the “boyfriend” dominance and control over the victim.

                                        By this stage, the victim may be in no position to refuse the
                                        “boyfriend’s” commands and is frightened and compliant. She
                                        may find herself in an unknown part of the city, or perhaps a
                                        different city all together. The victim realizes that she,
                                        her family, nor anyone else knows where she is. The victim may
                                        know the city or area they are in, but may be unable to provide
                                        family or police with their specific location if able to contact
                                        them. This element of control, exercised by the “boyfriend” and
                                        other men, reinforces the victim’s vulnerability and she becomes
                                        psychologically dependent.

                    The terms “pimp” and “trafficker” are not necessarily synonymous. Depending on the
                    jurisdiction, a pimp may not be violating any law. A pimp can be defined as one who
                    finds and manages clients for a prostitute and manages the women in prostitution in
                    order to profit from their earnings. A pimp may not necessarily force a woman to
                    stay with him in order to prostitute her. So, even if prostitution is illegal, a
                    pimp who doesn't use force, fraud, or coercion to compel adult women to prostitute
                    themselves would not be considered a trafficker.

                                    On the other hand, any pimp who knowingly manages a minor would be
                                    considered a trafficker. Additionally, a trafficker could be someone
                                    who knowingly profits from coerced prostitution even if he or she is
                                    not directly involved in the management of the prostitutes. For
                                    instance, a human smuggler in Guatemala would be considered a
                                    trafficker if he was knowingly bringing people to the U.S. to be
                                    trafficked, even though he would not be considered a pimp.
